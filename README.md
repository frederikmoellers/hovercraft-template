:class: oneatatime

One-at-a-time Slide
===================

* List items on this page
* Will appear

  * One at a time
  
* Once shown, they will stay until the page is reloaded. This should help navigating through the slideshow e.g. when answering questions afterwards.

.. note::

    As you can see, all items are immediately shown in the presenter console so the presenter always knows what's coming next.
    
    For the moment, this only works if the window with the presentation is focused. If the console is focused, it doesn't work (yet).

```
